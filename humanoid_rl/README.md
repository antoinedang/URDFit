NOTE: The "rl" folder is a python package.

To run a file inside this package, do as follows:

python3 -m humanoid_rl.[file_path]

for example, to run the "cpu_simulation.py" file, do:

python3 -m humanoid_rl.simulation.cpu_simulation

To import any file from the package externally, import from "humanoid_rl" as you would any other package like numpy, etc.
